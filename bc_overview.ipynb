We aim to present some of the main tips and tricks that the community have picked up during their time working with code that we wish we could have known about earlier. In this way we hope to advance the general level of computational fluency in the department, for the benefit of all. \n",

You can also do so many things with Python that itâ€™s easy to stick with the language for quite a while before needing something else. Python finds itself at home both creating Web apps like Instagram and helping researchers make sense of their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes in two flavours - Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 will soon be unsupported, and most libraries are gradually being ported over to Python 3. As a result, it's probably in your best interest to start with Python 3. The differences are slight, but there.\n",
